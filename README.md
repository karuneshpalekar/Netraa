A Frame Descriptor for Visually Impaired People


Under the mentorship of Prof. Deepti Vijay Chandran, we created an application that will help the visually impaired to enjoy the world. Our team created an application specifically designed to assist blind individuals with the ability to "see" through their smartphones.
The application provides frame descriptions of the surroundings captured by the smartphone camera, allowing blind users to have a better understanding of their surroundings. This is achieved through the use of ML and computer vision technologies that analyze the frames and provide a detailed description of the scene.
Our project aimed to address the challenges that blind people face in their daily lives and help them to live more independently. We believe that technology has the potential to make a positive impact on people's lives, and this project is an excellent example of that.
I am incredibly proud of the accomplishment and the positive impact that our project can have on the lives of those with visual impairments. I hope that our work inspires others to use technology to make a positive difference in the world.
We will continue our work on this project and lead it to the production level.


Here is a demonstration of our project in 2 parts -
